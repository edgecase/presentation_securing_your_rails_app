# TITLE: Securing Your Rails App

# PRESENTERS: Jim Weirich and Matt Yoho

# SHORT DESCRIPTION:

Given the many features of Rails that promote good security, one gets
the impression that your typical Rails web site is relatively secure.
That impression is completely misleading.  Without paying deliberate
attention to security details, it is almost certain that your
application has security flaws.  This talk will cover the ins and outs
of web security and help you build a secure site.

# ABSTRACT:

  "Then it starts to scan the computer and transmit bits of
  information every time he clicks the mouse while he's surfing. After
  a while, [...] we've accumulated a complete mirror image of the
  content of his hard drive [...].  And then it's time for the hostile
  takeover."

  -- Lisbeth Salander in Stieg Larsson's "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"

Hacker dramas like the Stieg Larrson book make for good fiction, but
we know that real life rarely matches drama.  And with all the
security features that Rails 3 has added, surely it is difficult to
hack a typical Rails web site.

Right?

Wrong!  Without deliberate attention to the details of security, it
almost certain that your site has flaws that a knowledgeable hacker
can exploit.  This talk will cover the ins and outs of web security
and help you build a site that is protected from the real Lisbeth
Salanders of the world.
